This application is a combincation of an assigment and a parlay simulator my professor wrote. It runs off the use off of first class functions. 

To play a parlay, a user is promtped to enter the bets they want to play, place an amount of money, and select a number to bet on. 

In this system, a parlay bet is executed by splitting the two input variables and looping through them. The betting input is contained in a 
variable named "bets" and the and the numbers to bet on variable is contained within a variable named "numbers". "bets" and "numbers" are
put inside the parameters of a global function. Under the "global_function", a "bets_choice_mapping" function is called, a "dice_roll"
variable is created, and for loop is executed that determines if the final outcome of the deciding variable "hit_check" is 0. 
If "hit_check" is 0, the parlay hits. 

As "bets_choice_mapping" is called, a random number is assigned to "dice_roll". "dice_roll" is then put inside the parameters of multiple functions
along with the original "numbers" variable. "bets_choice_mapping" creates an empty list named "bets_to_make". It runs a for loop, named "bet" that appends 
the outcome of the functions "dice_roll" and "number" were in to "bets_to_make". 1 or 0 is the only outcome of the functions "dice_roll" and
"numbers" were in, so "bets_to_make" is either 1 or 0. "bets_to_make" is then added to "hit_check", and if the final outcome is 0, then 
the parlay hits.
