# Before anything else, I separated my code into what each file does.
# For example, this file is named "Main" because it is where the main
# code is being executed. The second file is named "Choices", because
# that is where the user chooses which game to play. I decided to name my
# functions after which game they apply to. For example, the dice functions
# are named according to which die the user chooses. Whichever die the user chooses
# is whichever function will be executed. This makes for an easy understanding of which
# function does what, and easier for a person who did not write this code to understand
# which function is doing what. The same goes for the joker functions. They are named after what
# the user chooses. I intended to have a separation of concerns, so rather than having my
# functions inside the "Main" file, I put them in a different file. This makes for a less cluttered
# main file. I also decided to make just one "if" statement, with more "if" statements inside of it. The main "if"
# block contains an execution for whatever the user chooses. The other "if" statements will
# be executed dependent of whether the user chooses to take jokers out, or choose a
# specific die.
